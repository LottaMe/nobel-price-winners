## What's the question of the project?

Do the winners of the nobel price from 1901 to 2016 show a bias of the award, concerning age, sex country & having already won it?

## Why is this an interesting question?

Privilege exists in our world and it is reasonable to assume that it might play part in such a famous and popular award. It is interesting to see if the data supports such an assumptions or if sex, age, etc do not show a trend in the winners.

## What methods are used to answer the question?

- grouping (groupby)
  - by one column
  - by multiple columns
- counting values in goups (value_count)
- Creating new columns, by manipulating data in another column
- lineplot & lineplot with hue set
- getting the smallest and largest row of something with nsmallest, slargest
- filter
- lmplot & lmplot with row set, so we see multiple graphs

## What are the most important results?

The results that I found the most interesting, are that you can even in the later years see a definite trend in the female nobel price winners. Firstly in a truly equal world you could expect 50% of each category to be female. The highest it goes is 40% in 2016 for the nobel peace price, followed by literature (less then 30%) and medicine (less then 15%).

Even worse are areas that are traditionally seen as male (this also includes medicine to some extend), like Chemistry, Physics and Economics. Except a few peeks that do not go over 15% (this is a peek in chemistry in 1910) these areas seem to have 0% female winners in a majority of the years between 1901 and 2016.

## How do these results answer the question of the study?

It appears that there is a bias in the nobel price winners. You seem to be the most likely to win if you are around 50 and male.

## Summarize your most important learnings

It was interesting to work with plots again & practicing different data manipulations. I also felt like this guided project gabe a little less hints then the Lego one I did before and therefore was both more challenging and more fun.
